# Analysis


## Boyer, Justice, Storey, and Sturcke


#### Does the design address *change* task; How would you modify the task to make it a *change* task if not?

The author has overlaid disease progressions on top of each other with color encoding. This approach visualizes changes very effectively. 

#### How many items can the design show on a 24-inch monitor?

This design is an overview design. Therefore all of the data can be shown on a average sized screen.

#### Does it use overview+detail technique?

Yes and No. The authors have left out certain details about the diseases like actual date, patient and doctor info etc. But as we are focussing on the progression of the diseases, this approach captures the tasks efficiently.

#### Does it show "temporal" changes?

Yes. As the ticks on the disease lines represent encounters, temporal changes become evident with this design.

#### Whether or not it introduces clutter by comparing with all other designs?

Yes and No. As this is an overview viz, there is bound to be some clutter around the more information dense regions. But the authors have chosen dimensions well to keep clutter to a minimum.

#### Is the design visually pleasing?

Yes. The choice of color encoding and the flowing lines make this a beautiful viz. I would recommend a dark background for the colors to pop out more.

## Vashistha, Nallamothu, Chaudhari, Athley


#### Does the design address *change* task; How would you modify the task to make it a *change* task if not?

The authors have though hard and long about effectively visualizing the change task. But the approach seems over-engineered. Also this approach is not scalable. 

#### How many items can the design show on a 24-inch monitor?

The viz will be effective for small number of diseases.

#### Does it use overview+detail technique?

No. The viz. proposes a animation approach for the change task. All other details have been omitted from the design. 

#### Does it show "temporal" changes?

Yes. The authors have proposed a animated technique with points, lines and tails to visualize temporal changes.

#### Whether or not it introduces clutter by comparing with all other designs?

Yes. The viz will be cluttered as we are plotting multiple components for every patient.

#### Is the design visually pleasing?

Yes. The anumation  (if implemented correctly) will determine the visual appeal of the approach.

## Yorick, Abhishek


#### Does the design address *change* task; How would you modify the task to make it a *change* task if not?

This design with cloud lines is missing information on how it is going to encode data for multiple patients into the plot. The approach encapsulates change tasks well for a single patient, but fails at pr=otraying the same for all patients.


#### How many items can the design show on a 24-inch monitor?

The viz will be ineffective even for small number of diseases and patients.

#### Does it use overview+detail technique?

No. This technique follows an overview design.

#### Does it show "temporal" changes?

Yes. The cloud lines efefctively depict changes over time. 

#### Whether or not it introduces clutter by comparing with all other designs?

Yes. If all patients and encounters are plotted as cloud lines, the viz will have lots of clutter.

#### Is the design visually pleasing?

Yes. The smooth curves of the cloud lines will make the design visually appealing.

## Campbell, Latt, Chen, and Xie

#### Does the design address *change* task; How would you modify the task to make it a *change* task if not?

The authors have decided to encode the frequency of symptoms as the thickness of lines in a temporal setting. This approach although shows correlation between patients, but does not show correlation between symptoms.

#### How many items can the design show on a 24-inch monitor?

The viz will be effective for an average sized monitor.

#### Does it use overview+detail technique?

No. This technique abstracts and aggregates actual numbers and encodes the aggregates into visual representations.

#### Does it show "temporal" changes?

Yes. The way the X axis is set up, we are able to see temporal trends into the symptoms.

#### Whether or not it introduces clutter by comparing with all other designs?

No. This approach gives each symtom it's own screen real estate and discards any scope for clutter at the expense of showing only aggregate information.

#### Is the design visually pleasing?

Yes. The visual encoding principles employed in this design will make for a visually appealing visualization.

## Grasso, Koepper, Liu, Mercure, and Wu

#### Does the design address *change* task; How would you modify the task to make it a *change* task if not?

No. The authors have emphasized on the frequency of encounters relative to one another. This hides away the the changes in disease progressions.

#### How many items can the design show on a 24-inch monitor?

This being an adjacency matrix, all items can be aggregated and depicted on the screen.

#### Does it use overview+detail technique?

No. This technique aggregates the symptoms and encodes them as textures/luminesence.

#### Does it show "temporal" changes?

No. This technique hides all temporal changes in order to better identify changes in order of symptoms.

#### Whether or not it introduces clutter by comparing with all other designs?

No. The adjacency matrix approach removes all scope for clutter as there will be no overlaying of visual components in any way.

#### Is the design visually pleasing?

Yes. Although the matrix makes for a structed chaos pleasing design, it does not depict the change task effectively.
